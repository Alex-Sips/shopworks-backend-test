### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent roughly 6-7 hours on this. I spent about 2 hours planning, this took me a while and I couldnt figure out what was the best wat to calculate the time differences and how to deal with all the niche. I dont think the solution that i went with is the most elegent approach or the most simple given that there are going to have to be a lot of if statements in the code going down this route.

I also didnt know what DTO was so i had to do some research into it, which took a bit of time. I dont think the way I have done it is correct but I decided to make it an array of SingleManning's so they can be iterated through easier rather then the array being the objects.

If I had more time I would try to rewrite to solution so it does not require as many if statements as it makes to code difficult to read. I would also do more research into DTO and implement it correctly.

### 2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?

Coming from Ruby when I started and moving into PHP, has been a pretty smooth transition and I also prefer PHP because it follows very similer coding patterns to other languages which then makes it easier to read/learn other languages. I also really like the frame work laravel as it is very simple to use but also gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want.

### 3. What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)? 

The framework that I use is Laravel. One of my favrouiate things about laravel is its secure authentication using auth which makes it very to login a user or access to user at time (when logged in). Also comparing it to Rails it is a lot more obvious what is doing what and how to change things like writing middlewares. Also laravel and PHP are getting updated constantly. Also the eloquent ORM is very easy to use 

Another benefit of Laravel is that cause it is so abundant and has been around for so long there are a lot of 3rd party tools and packages for it that are extremely helpful. Also because laravel has been around for so long if you have an issue it is usually very easy to find a solution or similer solution that people have had in the past.

### 4. What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?

Even though this was in my pros its is also a con that Laravel is getting updated a lot which is good but can also be a bad thing if you dont constantly update your code or it could lead to some of the code being buggy or deprecated. 

Also when I first moved from Rails to Laravel is was a lot more complicated and a bit overwhelming, but once you learn where everything is, its great.

Another minor con that I came accross is that for PHP that isnt Laravel is that currently AWS Lambdas dont support PHP so you have to writea custom run time.
